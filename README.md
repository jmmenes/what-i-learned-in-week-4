# What I Learned In Week 4 At Code Immersives

## Functions

What is a Function?

A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.
Functions are executed when they are called. This is known as invoking a function.
Values can be passed into functions and used within the function.
Functions always return a value. In JavaScript, if no return value is specified, the function will return undefined.
Functions are objects.
Define a Function.
There are a few different ways to define a function in JavaScript:
A Function Declaration defines a named function. To create a function declaration you use the function keyword followed by the name of the function. When using function declarations, the function definition is hoisted, thus allowing the function to be used before it is defined.

## Return Values

1. git clone
2. git add
3. git commit -m
4. git push

I used these commands to fork/clone repositories. Which then allows me to edit/make changes to files. After the changes are made I will make a commit to highlight what changes were made. The last step is to push the commit back to the source on GitHub.

## Parameters

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.

How to link external JS to HTML

    <script src="script.js"></script>

How to link internal JS with HTML

    <script> JS Code </script>

## Booleans

JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. You declare a JavaScript variable with the keywords, 'let' or 'const'

JS primitive data types

1. Strings
2. Numbers
3. Booleans = True or False
4. NaN = Not a number
5. Null = The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as falsy for boolean operations.
6. Undefined = The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or not declared at all.

## && || if else

Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

let name = ‘Hello World’

const name = “Hello World”

&nbsp;

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals

let age = 2

const age = 2.5

## Variable Re-Assignment & String Concatenation.

Practiced learning about code logic & how declaring variables with the let keyword can be changed with different values.

To concatenate a string, you add a plus sign + between the strings or string variables you want to connect.

    let myPet = 'seahorse';
    console.log('My favorite animal is the ' + myPet + '.');
    // My favorite animal is the seahorse.
